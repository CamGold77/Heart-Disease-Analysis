# Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting the likelihood of heart disease. The notebook performs exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning model training to achieve accurate predictions.


## Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning models, offering insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalization, and encoding.
- Multiple machine learning models for prediction:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Visualizations to illustrate key trends and model performance.

## Requirements
- Python (>= 3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
 ```markdown
   git clone https://github.com/camgold77/Heart-Disease-Analysis.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```markdown    
cd heart-disease-analysis
```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```markdown
   pip install -r requirements.txt
``
4. Run the notebook cells step by step to:
- Explore the dataset.
- Preprocess the data.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various health metrics (e.g., age, cholesterol level, blood pressure) and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Ensure the dataset file is present in the working directory before running the notebook.

## Results
The project evaluates model performance using metrics like:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
